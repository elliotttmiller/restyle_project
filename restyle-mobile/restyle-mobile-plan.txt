Why React Native is a Great Fit for Re-Style
Code Reusability (The #1 Advantage): You have already built a significant portion of your UI logic in React (LoginPage.js, DashboardPage.js, etc.). With React Native, you can reuse a massive amount of your existing frontend code, including components, state management (Zustand), and API services (Axios). You will be rewriting the "View" part (the JSX) to use native components (<View> instead of <div>, <Text> instead of <p>), but the underlying logic, state, and data flow remain nearly identical. This will cut your development time dramatically.
Cross-Platform by Default: By building with React Native, you are simultaneously building for both iOS and Android. This doubles your potential market with very little extra effort compared to building two separate native apps.
Easier Team Scaling: A web developer who knows React can be productive on your mobile app almost immediately, which is a huge advantage for hiring and team growth.
Excellent Performance: For an application like yours, which is primarily data-driven (fetching and displaying lists, forms, etc.), the performance of a modern React Native app is virtually indistinguishable from a native app for the end-user.
Given that your app is not a high-performance 3D game or a complex photo editor, the benefits of React Native far outweigh any minor performance trade-offs.
Here is the revised, complete roadmap using the React Native path.

Mobile Application Development Plan (React Native Path): Re-Style Mobile
Project Vision: To leverage our existing React web application codebase to rapidly develop a cross-platform mobile app for both iOS and Android. The app will provide a seamless, native-feeling experience for resellers, utilizing device-specific features like the camera to create a powerful on-the-go tool.
Technology & Architecture
Framework: React Native (using the Expo managed workflow for simplicity and faster development).
Language: JavaScript/TypeScript (allowing you to reuse your existing skills and code).
UI Components: React Native core components (<View>, <Text>, <ScrollView>) and a component library like React Native Paper or React Native Elements for pre-styled, native-looking UI controls.
Architecture: The same component-based architecture as your web app.
State Management: Zustand (You can reuse your existing authStore.js with almost no changes).
Navigation: React Navigation (the standard for routing in React Native).
API Interaction: Axios (Your existing api.js service will work with minimal changes).
Development Environment: VS Code, Xcode (for building/simulating iOS), Android Studio (for building/simulating Android).

Detailed Development Sprints

Sprint 0: Project Setup & Code Migration
(Time Estimate: 1 Week, Priority: Critical)
Goal: Establish the React Native project and migrate our existing web app's core logic into a shared location.
Task 1 (High): Initialize React Native Project.
Use the Expo CLI to create a new React Native project: npx create-expo-app restyle-mobile.
Set up a new Git repository for this mobile project.


Task 2 (Critical): Create a Shared "Core" Library.
This is the key to code reuse. Create a directory outside of both your frontend and restyle-mobile projects that will hold the shared logic.
Move your existing authStore.js (Zustand) and api.js (Axios) files into this new shared library.
Configure both your web app and your new mobile app to import the store and API service from this shared location. This is often done using path mapping (e.g., tsconfig.json or babel.config.js).


Task 3 (High): Implement Mobile Authentication.
The AuthService logic can be reused. The only change is how you store the JWT. Instead of localStorage, you will use AsyncStorage or a secure keychain library for React Native. The zustand-persist middleware can be configured to use AsyncStorage.


Task 4 (Medium): Set up Navigation.
Install and configure React Navigation.
Set up a basic stack navigator that can switch between a LoginScreen and a main AppStack.


Sprint 1: Mobile Authentication & Onboarding UI
(Time Estimate: 1 Week, Priority: High)
Goal: Build the native login and registration screens.
Task 1 (High): Build Login Screen.
Create a LoginScreen.js component.
Use React Native's <View>, <Text>, <TextInput>, and <Button> components to build the UI.
Reuse the exact same logic from your web LoginForm.js component (the useState hooks and the handleSubmit function that calls your shared API service).


Task 2 (Medium): Build Registration Screen.
Create a RegisterScreen.js component, reusing the logic from your (to-be-built) web registration form.


Task 3 (High): Implement App Entry Logic.
In your main App.js, use a useEffect hook to check your shared useAuthStore upon launch.
The navigator will automatically show either the LoginScreen or the main app dashboard based on the isAuthenticated flag in the store.


Sprint 2: Mobile Inventory Dashboard
(Time Estimate: 1.5 Weeks, Priority: High)
Goal: Replicate the web dashboard with a native look and feel.
Task 1 (High): Build Dashboard Screen.
Create a DashboardScreen.js component.
Reuse the same useEffect logic from your web ItemList.js that calls the GET /core/items/ endpoint.
Use React Native's <FlatList> or <ScrollView> to display the list of items.


Task 2 (High): Build Item Row Component.
Create a reusable ItemRow.js component. The JSX will use <View> and <Text>, but the props it receives (item) and the data it displays will be identical to your web component.


Task 3 (High): Implement "Add Item" Modal.
Create an "Add Item" button on the dashboard.
Tapping it will open a React Native <Modal> component.
Inside the modal, create an AddItemForm component. Again, the UI will use native <TextInput>s, but the state management and handleSubmit logic can be copied directly from your web AddItemForm.js.



New Feature Sprints (Mobile First)

Sprint 3: Live eBay Search Bar
(Time Estimate: 1 Week, Priority: High)
Goal: Implement the new live eBay search feature in the mobile app.
Task 1 (High): Create Backend Endpoint (If not already done).
Ensure the /api/search/ebay/?q=... endpoint exists and works in your Django backend.


Task 2 (High): Build Search Screen.
Create a SearchScreen.js component in React Native.
Use a <TextInput> as the search bar.
Reuse the same debounced fetching logic from the web version to call your backend search endpoint as the user types.


Task 3 (Medium): "Add to Inventory" Flow.
When a user taps a search result, navigate them to the "Add Item" form, passing the search result data as route parameters. The form will be pre-filled, and the user can save it to their inventory.


Sprint 4: AI Image Recognition & Search
(Time Estimate: 2-3 Weeks, Priority: Critical - Future Feature)
Goal: Leverage the mobile device's camera for the AI search feature.
Task 1 (High): Integrate Camera/Photo Library.
Use a library like expo-image-picker to allow the user to either take a new photo or select an existing one from their phone's gallery. This is a huge advantage of mobile.


Task 2 (Critical): Implement Backend AI Service.
Create the /api/ai/image-search/ endpoint in Django. This endpoint will receive the uploaded image data.
It will securely call a third-party service like Google Cloud Vision API with the image.
It will get back descriptive keywords (e.g., "blue denim jacket").


Task 3 (High): Connect AI to Search.
The backend will take the keywords from the AI service and immediately feed them into your existing eBay search logic.
The final search results are returned to the mobile app.


Task 4 (High): Build the AI Search UI Flow.
A simple UI with a "Scan Item" button.
Tapping the button opens the camera/gallery picker.
The app shows a loading indicator while the backend does the heavy lifting.
The final search results are displayed in a list, just like the text search.


Sprint 5 & Beyond: Completing the App
Task (High): Implement the native UI for the Market Analysis results page, reusing the fetching logic.
Task (High): Implement the native UI for Creating a New Listing on eBay.
Task (Medium): Implement Push Notifications using Expo's push notification service to alert users when a listing is created or an analysis is complete.
Task (Low): Build and Deploy. Use Expo Application Services (EAS) to build the .ipa (iOS) and .apk (Android) files and submit them to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

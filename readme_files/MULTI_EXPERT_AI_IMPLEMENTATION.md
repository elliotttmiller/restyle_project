# Multi-Expert AI System Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of a cutting-edge, multi-expert AI system that integrates Amazon Rekognition and Google Gemini API to significantly improve accuracy in product identification and market analysis. The system follows a purely AI-driven approach with no hardcoded logic.

## Architecture

### The "Panel of Experts" Approach

Our system implements a sophisticated multi-expert architecture:

1. **Google Vision API** - The Market Researcher
   - Specializes in WEB_DETECTION for branded product identification
   - Provides object localization and OCR capabilities
   - Most reliable for specific product names and brands

2. **Amazon Rekognition** - The Object Specialist
   - Excellent at general-purpose object and scene detection
   - Provides a second opinion on category classification
   - Trained on Amazon's massive product dataset

3. **Google Gemini** - The Chief Synthesizer
   - Acts as the "brain" that reasons over multiple AI opinions
   - Synthesizes conflicting information into high-confidence conclusions
   - Provides structured JSON output with confidence scores

4. **Self-Hosted CLIP Model** - The Visual Arbiter
   - Performs visual re-ranking of marketplace results
   - Ensures results actually look like the user's item
   - Our "secret sauce" for superior user experience

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

#### Dependencies Added

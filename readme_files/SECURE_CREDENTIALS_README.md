# 🔐 Secure Credential Management System

This project now uses a **secure credential management system** that prevents credentials from being committed to git while maintaining full functionality.

## 🚀 Quick Setup

1. **Run the setup script:**
   ```bash
   python setup_credentials.py
   ```

2. **Add your credentials:**
   - Edit `.env` with your real credentials
   - Edit `backend/backend/local_settings.py` with your real credentials
   - Place credential files in project root

3. **You're done!** 🎉

## 📁 Protected Files

The following files are **automatically ignored** by git:
- `.env` - Environment variables
- `*.json` - Google Cloud credentials
- `*.csv` - AWS credentials  
- `__pycache__/` - Python cache files
- Any file with credentials in the name

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Environment Variables
Credentials are loaded from environment variables first:
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path/to/credentials.json
```

### 2. .env File (Local Development)
For local development, use a `.env` file:
```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./google-credentials.json
```

### 3. Credential Files
Place your credential files in the project root:
- `google-credentials.json` - Google Cloud service account
- `aws-credentials.csv` - AWS access keys

## 🛡️ Security Features

### ✅ What's Protected
- All credential files are gitignored
- Template files show structure without real data
- Environment variables override file credentials
- Automatic validation of credential availability

### ✅ What's Safe to Commit
- Template files (`env.template`, `local_settings_template.py`)
- Configuration structure (without real values)
- Code that uses the credential manager

## 🔄 Workflow

### For Development
1. Copy templates to real files
2. Add your credentials
3. Work normally - credentials stay local

### For Deployment
1. Set environment variables on server
2. Place credential files on server
3. No code changes needed

### For Team Members
1. Run `python setup_credentials.py`
2. Add their own credentials
3. Work independently

## 📋 File Structure

```
restyle_project/
├── .env                    # Your credentials (gitignored)
├── env.template           # Template (safe to commit)
├── google-credentials.json # Google Cloud (gitignored)
├── aws-credentials.csv    # AWS credentials (gitignored)
├── backend/
│   └── backend/
│       ├── local_settings.py      # Your settings (gitignored)
│       └── local_settings_template.py # Template (safe)
└── setup_credentials.py   # Setup script (safe)
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Credentials not found" error
1. Check that your credential files exist
2. Verify paths in `.env` and `local_settings.py`
3. Run `python setup_credentials.py` to recreate templates

### "Permission denied" error
1. Check file permissions on credential files
2. Ensure credential files are readable by the application

### "Service unavailable" error
1. Check credential validation: `credential_manager.validate_credentials()`
2. Verify API keys are active and have correct permissions

## 🔍 Validation

Check your credential status:
```python
from backend.core.credential_manager import credential_manager

status = credential_manager.get_status()
print(status)
```

## 🎯 Benefits

- ✅ **Never commit credentials again**
- ✅ **Easy team collaboration**
- ✅ **Secure deployment**
- ✅ **Automatic validation**
- ✅ **Template-based setup**
- ✅ **Environment variable support**

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Run `python setup_credentials.py`
2. Add your real credentials to the generated files
3. Test the system with `python test_files/test_credential_manager.py`
4. Commit and push safely! 🎉

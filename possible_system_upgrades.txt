Key Enhancement Opportunities

Simplify and Centralize API Logic: Your views.py contains a lot of direct requests calls to the eBay API. This logic can be extracted into a dedicated service, making your views cleaner and the eBay logic reusable.

Revolutionize the AI Search Flow: Your current hybrid_image_search is a clever but indirect "image-to-text-to-search-to-rerank" flow. We will enhance this by implementing the direct image-to-image Google Vision Product Search we've been working towards, and using your existing hybrid search as a powerful fallback.

Optimize Database Performance: We can make your data access faster with standard Django optimizations that reduce the number of database queries.


Phase 1: Code Structure & Refactoring (The Foundation)
Before adding new features, let's refactor the existing code for better maintainability. We'll create a dedicated EbayService to handle all interactions with the eBay API.

Action 1: Create a New services.py File

Create a new file in your core app: backend/core/services.py.

Generated python


# File: backend/core/services.py

import requests
import logging
from .ebay_auth import get_ebay_oauth_token

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class EbayService:
    """
    A centralized service for all interactions with the eBay API.
    """
    BASE_URL = "https://api.ebay.com/buy/browse/v1"

    def __init__(self):
        self.auth_token = get_ebay_oauth_token()
        if not self.auth_token:
            logger.error("[EbayService] Failed to initialize: No valid eBay OAuth token available.")
            # This could raise a custom exception to be handled by the caller
            raise ConnectionError("No valid eBay OAuth token available.")
    
    def get_headers(self):
        return {
            'Authorization': f'Bearer {self.auth_token}',
            'X-EBAY-C-MARKETPLACE-ID': 'EBAY_US',
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'Accept': 'application/json',
        }

    def search_items(self, query: str, category_ids: str = None, limit: int = 20) -> list:
        """
        Performs a search for item summaries on eBay.
        """
        endpoint = f"{self.BASE_URL}/item_summary/search"
        params = {'q': query, 'limit': limit}
        if category_ids:
            params['category_ids'] = category_ids

        logger.info(f"[EbayService] Searching eBay with query: '{query}'")
        try:
            response = requests.get(endpoint, headers=self.get_headers(), params=params, timeout=15)
            response.raise_for_status()  # Raises an HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
            
            data = response.json()
            items = data.get('itemSummaries', [])
            logger.info(f"[EbayService] Found {len(items)} items for query: '{query}'")
            return items

        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            logger.error(f"[EbayService] Search request failed: {e}")
            return []
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"[EbayService] An unexpected error occurred during search: {e}")
            return []
Use code with caution.
Python
Action 2: Refactor views.py to Use the New Service
Your AIImageSearchView becomes much simpler. The responsibility for talking to eBay is now delegated.
Generated python
# File: backend/core/views.py
# Add this new import at the top
from .services import EbayService
from .ai_service import get_ai_service # Keep this

# ... other imports ...

@method_decorator(csrf_exempt, name='dispatch')
class AIImageSearchView(APIView):
    permission_classes = [permissions.IsAuthenticated]
    
    def post(self, request):
        print("--- ENHANCED AI SEARCH VIEW ---")
        image_file = request.FILES.get('image')
        if not image_file:
            return Response({'error': 'No image file provided'}, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
        
        try:
            image_data = image_file.read()
            ai_service = get_ai_service()
            
            # This is now the primary, direct visual search
            # We'll implement google_product_search in the next phase
            google_results = ai_service.google_product_search(image_data)
            
            # Use a fallback if the direct search yields no good results
            if not google_results or google_results[0]['score'] < 0.6: # Example threshold
                print("Direct search had low confidence. Falling back to Hybrid Search.")
                # The hybrid search now uses the EbayService internally
                hybrid_results = ai_service.hybrid_image_search(image_data, top_k=10)
            else:
                hybrid_results = [] # Or you could choose to run both

            return Response({
                'message': 'AI search successful.',
                'direct_visual_search_results': google_results,
                'fallback_hybrid_results': hybrid_results
            }, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)

        except Exception as e:

            return Response({'error': f'An unexpected error occurred: {str(e)}'}, status=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)

Phase 2: Revolutionize the AI Search Flow (The Main Event)
Now we upgrade ai_service.py to use the direct Google Vision Product Search and integrate our new EbayService.

Phase 3: Performance and Untapped Potential
Action 4: Optimize Database Queries
In views that list items or details with related objects, use select_related and prefetch_related to prevent excessive database queries.
Generated python
# Example in backend/core/views.py

class ItemListCreateView(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
    # ...
    def get_queryset(self):
        # OLD: return Item.objects.filter(owner=self.request.user)
        # NEW:
        return Item.objects.filter(owner=self.request.user).select_related(
            'owner', 'analysis'
        ).prefetch_related('listings')

class ItemDetailView(generics.RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView):
    # ...
    def get_queryset(self):
        # OLD: return Item.objects.filter(owner=self.request.user)
        # NEW:
        return Item.objects.filter(owner=self.request.user).select_related(
            'owner', 'analysis'
        ).prefetch_related('listings')
Use code with caution.

Summary of Enhancements
Centralized eBay Logic: All eBay calls are now in a clean, reusable EbayService.
Upgraded AI Search: You now have a primary, direct google_product_search and your original, sophisticated hybrid search acts as an intelligent fallback.
Simplified Views: Your AIImageSearchView is now much cleaner and easier to read, delegating work to the services.
Faster Database: Key querysets are optimized to be more efficient.
Future-Proofed: A clear path is laid out to activate your powerful SearchFeedback model.
By implementing these changes, your backend will be more robust, maintainable, and will deliver a significantly more accurate and powerful core feature to your users.
